      <b> The horse</b> is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs
      to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of
      Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years
      from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed
      animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and
      their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE.
      <b> Horses</b> in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some
      domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral
      populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe
      horses that have never been domesticated. <b> Horses</b> are adapted to
      run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent
      sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this
      need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are
      able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending
      to sleep significantly more than adults. <b> Female horses</b> , called
      <b> mares</b> , carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young
      horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most
      domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between
      the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five,
      and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are
      loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament:
      spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as
      draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and
      "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods,
      often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes,
      particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the
      world today, developed for many different uses.
